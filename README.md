## SnowyTop Maths

A full stack web application, designed to be an educational resource for children sitting school entrance exams. It consists of a range of tutorial videosand questions. Users can sign up and login where they are redirected to the profile page. Then they can choose from a range of chapters to enter, watch the video and answer the questions below. I used an api to increase the score by 10 points (or 20/30) every time a correct answer is entered.

I used the following technologies to build the app:


`Backend:`


Node JS/Express

MongoDB/Mongoose

`Frontend:`

Javascript

HTML

CSS/Bootstrap

Deployed online here:  https://www.snowytopmaths.co.uk/
